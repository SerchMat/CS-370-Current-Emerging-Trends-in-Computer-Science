## PROJECT SUMMARY
The following project is Reinforcement Deep Learning. We are provided with the necessary to run the specific treasure hunting games - such as the moves, point system, etc. We are required to create the Q-Algoritnm for storing and saving the different experiences the agent goes through to achieve its goal of finding the treasure. 
I wrote code that addressed creating each episode, epoch loops when it was appropriate to switch between a random move or the quality algorithm when to reference the actions taken in the neural network to use in later episodes, and the win and loss states. Project two came loaded with both the Keras and dependent libraries in addition to the model structure used in the neural network. Additionally, it was loaded with controllers for the default variables that the model parameters and the number of episodes use to initiate the treasure hunter program.
